# EA GapAngle Code Development

This code is an expert advisor (EA) that trades based on the concept of price deviations from envelope and zigzag indicators. The EA identifies when the current price is above the upper envelope and below the zigzag high, or below the lower envelope and above the zigzag low, and opens corresponding sell or buy trades, respectively.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is executed during the expert advisor initialization. It can be used to perform any necessary initialization tasks. In this code, no specific initialization tasks are included.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is executed during the expert advisor deinitialization. It can be used to perform any necessary deinitialization tasks. In this code, no specific deinitialization tasks are included.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main execution function of the expert advisor. It is called on each tick of the price. In this code, the following steps are performed:

1. Get the current price using `SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_BID)`.
2. Calculate the upper and lower envelope indicator values using `iEnvelopes()`.
3. Check if the current price is above the upper envelope.
4. If it is, calculate the zigzag high and check if the current price is below it.
5. If it is, open a sell trade using `OrderSend()`.
6. Check if the current price is below the lower envelope.
7. If it is, calculate the zigzag low and check if the current price is above it.
8. If it is, open a buy trade using `OrderSend()`.

Note: The values used for the envelope and zigzag indicators are hardcoded in this code. You may need to adjust them based on your trading strategy and preferences.
